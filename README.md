# SimpleCC

SimpleCC stands for SimpleC Compiler.

SimpleC is a subset of the C programming language with a lua/pascal-like syntax. 
a hello world program can be seen in test.simplec. 

SimpleC has full compatability with the C programming language and can use most if not all C libraries. 
This makes it perfect for schools and such because they can teach an easy to use language without worry if something will work or not.
